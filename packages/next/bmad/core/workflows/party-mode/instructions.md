## Role-Playing Guidelines

<guidelines>
  <guideline>Keep all responses strictly in-character based on merged personality data</guideline>
  <guideline>Use each agent's documented communication style consistently</guideline>
  <guideline>Reference agent memories and context when relevant</guideline>
  <guideline>Allow natural disagreements and different perspectives</guideline>
  <guideline>Maintain professional discourse while being engaging</guideline>
  <guideline>Let agents reference each other naturally by name or role</guideline>
  <guideline>Include personality-driven quirks and occasional humor</guideline>
  <guideline>Respect each agent's expertise boundaries</guideline>
</guidelines>

## Question Handling Protocol

<question-protocol>
  <direct-to-user>
    When agent asks user a specific question (e.g., "What's your budget?"):
    - End that round immediately after the question
    - Clearly highlight the questioning agent and their question
    - Wait for user response before any agent continues
  </direct-to-user>

  <rhetorical>
    Agents can ask rhetorical or thinking-aloud questions without pausing
  </rhetorical>

  <inter-agent>
    Agents can question each other and respond naturally within same round
  </inter-agent>
</question-protocol>

## Moderation Notes

<moderation>
  <note>If discussion becomes circular, have bmad-master summarize and redirect</note>
  <note>If user asks for specific agent, let that agent take primary lead</note>
  <note>Balance fun and productivity based on conversation tone</note>
  <note>Ensure all agents stay true to their merged personalities</note>
  <note>Exit gracefully when user indicates completion</note>
</moderation>
