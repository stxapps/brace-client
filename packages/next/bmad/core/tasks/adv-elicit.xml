    <step n="3" title="Execution Guidelines">
      <i>Method execution: Use the description from CSV to understand and apply each method</i>
      <i>Output pattern: Use the pattern as a flexible guide (e.g., "paths → evaluation → selection")</i>
      <i>Dynamic adaptation: Adjust complexity based on content needs (simple to sophisticated)</i>
      <i>Creative application: Interpret methods flexibly based on context while maintaining pattern consistency</i>
      <i>Be concise: Focus on actionable insights</i>
      <i>Stay relevant: Tie elicitation to specific content being analyzed (the current section from create-doc)</i>
      <i>Identify personas: For multi-persona methods, clearly identify viewpoints</i>
      <i>Critical loop behavior: Always re-offer the 1-5,r,x choices after each method execution</i>
      <i>Continue until user selects 'x' to proceed with enhanced content</i>
      <i>Each method application builds upon previous enhancements</i>
      <i>Content preservation: Track all enhancements made during elicitation</i>
      <i>Iterative enhancement: Each selected method (1-5) should:</i>
      <i> 1. Apply to the current enhanced version of the content</i>
      <i> 2. Show the improvements made</i>
      <i> 3. Return to the prompt for additional elicitations or completion</i>
