<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project_root}/bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {installed_path}/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>This workflow assembles a Story Context XML for a single user story by extracting ACs, tasks, relevant docs/code, interfaces, constraints, and testing guidance to support implementation.</critical>
<critical>Default execution mode: #yolo (non-interactive). Only ask if {{non_interactive}} == false. If auto-discovery fails, HALT and request 'story_path' or 'story_dir'.</critical>

  <step n="1" goal="Check and load workflow status file">
    <action>Search {output_folder}/ for files matching pattern: bmm-workflow-status.md</action>
    <action>Find the most recent file (by date in filename: bmm-workflow-status.md)</action>

    <check if="exists">
      <action>Load the status file</action>
      <action>Extract key information:</action>
      - current_step: What workflow was last run
      - next_step: What workflow should run next
      - planned_workflow: The complete workflow journey table
      - progress_percentage: Current progress
      - IN PROGRESS story: The story being worked on (from Implementation Progress section)

      <action>Set status_file_found = true</action>
      <action>Store status_file_path for later updates</action>

      <check if='next_step != "story-context" AND current_step != "story-ready"'>
        <ask>**⚠️ Workflow Sequence Note**

Status file shows:
- Current step: {{current_step}}
- Expected next: {{next_step}}

This workflow (story-context) is typically run after story-ready.

Options:
1. Continue anyway (story-context is optional)
2. Exit and run the expected workflow: {{next_step}}
3. Check status with workflow-status

What would you like to do?</ask>
        <action>If user chooses exit → HALT with message: "Run workflow-status to see current state"</action>
      </check>
    </check>

    <check if="not exists">
      <ask>**No workflow status file found.**

The status file tracks progress across all workflows and provides context about which story to work on.

Options:
1. Run workflow-status first to create the status file (recommended)
2. Continue in standalone mode (no progress tracking)
3. Exit

What would you like to do?</ask>
      <action>If user chooses option 1 → HALT with message: "Please run workflow-status first, then return to story-context"</action>
      <action>If user chooses option 2 → Set standalone_mode = true and continue</action>
      <action>If user chooses option 3 → HALT</action>

      <output>**✅ Story Context Generated Successfully**

**Story Details:**
- Story ID: {{story_id}}
- Title: {{story_title}}
- Context File: {{default_output_file}}

**Status file updated:**
- Current step: story-context (Story {{story_id}}) ✓
- Progress: {{new_progress_percentage}}%

**Next Steps:**
1. Load DEV agent (bmad/bmm/agents/dev.md)
2. Run `dev-story` workflow to implement the story
3. The context file will provide comprehensive implementation guidance

Check status anytime with: `workflow-status`

**Story Details:**
- Story ID: {{story_id}}
