# Narrative Design Workflow

<workflow>

<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project_root}/bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already completed the GDD workflow</critical>
<critical>This workflow creates detailed narrative content for story-driven games</critical>
<critical>Uses narrative_template for output</critical>
<critical>If users mention gameplay mechanics, note them but keep focus on narrative</critical>
<critical>Facilitate good brainstorming techniques throughout with the user, pushing them to come up with much of the narrative you will help weave together. The goal is for the user to feel that they crafted the narrative and story arc unless they push you to do it all or indicate YOLO</critical>

<step n="1" goal="Load GDD context and assess narrative complexity">

<action>Load GDD.md from {output_folder}</action>
<action>Extract game_type, game_name, and any narrative mentions</action>

<ask>What level of narrative complexity does your game have?

**Narrative Complexity:**

1. **Critical** - Story IS the game (Visual Novel, Text-Based Adventure)
2. **Heavy** - Story drives the experience (Story-driven RPG, Narrative Adventure)
3. **Moderate** - Story enhances gameplay (Metroidvania, Tactics RPG, Horror)
4. **Light** - Story provides context (most other genres)

Your game type ({{game_type}}) suggests **{{suggested_complexity}}**. Confirm or adjust:</ask>

<action>Set narrative_complexity</action>

<check if="complexity == "Light"">
<ask>Light narrative games usually don't need a full Narrative Design Document. Are you sure you want to continue?

- GDD story sections may be sufficient
- Consider just expanding GDD narrative notes
- Proceed with full narrative workflow

Your choice:</ask>

<action>Load narrative_template from workflow.yaml</action>
