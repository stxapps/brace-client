## Strategy Specific Elements

### Resource Systems

{{resource_systems}}

**Resource management:**

- Resource types (gold, food, energy, population, etc.)
- Gathering mechanics (auto-generate, harvesting, capturing)
- Resource spending (units, buildings, research, upgrades)
- Economic balance (income vs. expenses)
- Scarcity and strategic choices

### Unit Types and Stats

{{unit_types}}

**Unit design:**

- Unit roster (basic, advanced, specialized, hero units)
- Unit stats (health, attack, defense, speed, range)
- Unit abilities (active, passive, unique)
- Counter systems (rock-paper-scissors dynamics)
- Unit production (cost, build time, prerequisites)

### Technology and Progression

{{tech_progression}}

**Progression systems:**

- Tech tree structure (linear, branching, era-based)
- Research mechanics (time, cost, prerequisites)
- Upgrade paths (unit upgrades, building improvements)
- Unlock conditions (progression gates, achievements)

### Map and Terrain

{{map_terrain}}

**Strategic space:**

- Map size and structure (small/medium/large, symmetric/asymmetric)
- Terrain types (passable, impassable, elevated, water)
- Terrain effects (movement, combat bonuses, vision)
- Strategic points (resources, objectives, choke points)
- Fog of war / vision system

### AI Opponent

{{ai_opponent}}

**AI design:**

- AI difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard, expert)
- AI behavior patterns (aggressive, defensive, economic, adaptive)
- AI cheating considerations (fair vs. challenge-focused)
- AI personality types (if multiple opponents)

### Victory Conditions

{{victory_conditions}}

**Win/loss design:**

- Victory types (domination, economic, technological, diplomatic, etc.)
- Time limits (if applicable)
- Score systems (if applicable)
- Defeat conditions
- Early surrender / concession mechanics
