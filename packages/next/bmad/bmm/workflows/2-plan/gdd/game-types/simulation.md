## Simulation Specific Elements

### Core Simulation Systems

{{simulation_systems}}

**What's being simulated:**

- Primary simulation focus (city, farm, business, ecosystem, etc.)
- Simulation depth (abstract vs. realistic)
- System interconnections
- Emergent behaviors
- Simulation tickrate and performance

### Management Mechanics

{{management_mechanics}}

**Management systems:**

- Resource management (budget, materials, time)
- Decision-making mechanics
- Automation vs. manual control
- Delegation systems (if applicable)
- Efficiency optimization

### Building and Construction

{{building_construction}}

**Construction systems:**

- Placeable objects/structures
- Grid system (free placement, snap-to-grid, tiles)
- Building prerequisites and unlocks
- Upgrade/demolition mechanics
- Space constraints and planning

### Economic and Resource Loops

{{economic_loops}}

**Economic design:**

- Income sources
- Expenses and maintenance
- Supply chains (if applicable)
- Market dynamics
- Economic balance and pacing

### Progression and Unlocks

{{progression_unlocks}}

**Progression systems:**

- Unlock conditions (achievements, milestones, levels)
- Tech/research tree
- New mechanics/features over time
- Difficulty scaling
- Endgame content

### Sandbox vs. Scenario

{{sandbox_scenario}}

**Game modes:**

- Sandbox mode (unlimited resources, creative freedom)
- Scenario/campaign mode (specific goals, constraints)
- Challenge modes
- Random/procedural scenarios
- Custom scenario creation
