# GDD Workflow - Game Projects (All Levels)

<workflow>

<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project_root}/bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {installed_path}/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>This is the GDD instruction set for GAME projects - replaces PRD with Game Design Document</critical>
<critical>Project analysis already completed - proceeding with game-specific design</critical>
<critical>Uses gdd_template for GDD output, game_types.csv for type-specific sections</critical>
<critical>Routes to 3-solutioning for architecture (platform-specific decisions handled there)</critical>
<critical>If users mention technical details, append to technical_preferences with timestamp</critical>

  <action>Exit current workflow (narrative will hand off to solutioning when done)</action>

Since this is a Level {{project_level}} game project, you need solutioning for platform/engine architecture.

**Start new chat with solutioning workflow and provide:**

1. This GDD: `{{gdd_output_file}}`
2. Project analysis: `{{analysis_file}}`

**The solutioning workflow will:**

- Determine game engine/platform (Unity, Godot, Phaser, custom, etc.)
- Generate solution-architecture.md with engine-specific decisions
- Create per-epic tech specs
- Handle platform-specific architecture (from registry.csv game-\* entries)
