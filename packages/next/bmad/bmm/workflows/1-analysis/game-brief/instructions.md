</step>

<step n="3" goal="Define game vision" if="collaboration_mode == 'interactive'">
<ask>Let's capture your game vision.

**Core Concept** - What is your game in one sentence?
Example: "A roguelike deck-builder where you climb a mysterious spire"

**Elevator Pitch** - Describe your game in 2-3 sentences as if pitching to a publisher or player.
Example: "Slay the Spire fuses card games and roguelikes together. Craft a unique deck, encounter bizarre creatures, discover relics of immense power, and kill the Spire."

**Vision Statement** - What is the aspirational goal for this game? What experience do you want to create?
Example: "Create a deeply replayable tactical card game that rewards strategic thinking while maintaining the excitement of randomness. Every run should feel unique but fair."
