# Game Brainstorming Workflow

This workflow employs structured ideation methodologies to generate and refine game concepts through systematic creative exploration. It leverages five distinct brainstorming techniques—SCAMPER, Mind Mapping, Lotus Blossom, Six Thinking Hats, and Random Word Association—each applied in isolation to produce diverse conceptual approaches. The workflow emphasizes iterative refinement where initial concepts are evaluated against design pillars, technical feasibility, and market positioning to identify the most promising directions.

The system operates through a game-specific context framework that considers platform constraints, target audience characteristics, monetization models, and core gameplay pillars. Each brainstorming method generates distinct artifacts: SCAMPER produces systematic modification analyses, Mind Mapping reveals conceptual hierarchies, Lotus Blossom creates radial expansion patterns, Six Thinking Hats enforces multi-perspective evaluation, and Random Word Association drives lateral thinking breakthroughs. The workflow culminates in a consolidated concept document that synthesizes the strongest elements from each method into cohesive game proposals.

Critical to this workflow is its emphasis on constraint-driven creativity. The game-context.md framework establishes technical boundaries (platform capabilities, performance targets), market parameters (genre conventions, competitive positioning), and design philosophy (accessibility requirements, monetization ethics) that ground creative exploration in practical realities. This prevents ideation from drifting into infeasible territory while maintaining creative ambition.

## Usage

```bash
bmad bmm 1-analysis brainstorm-game
```

## Inputs

- **Game Context Document**: Platform specifications, genre preferences, technical constraints, target audience demographics, monetization approach, and core design pillars
- **Initial Concept Seed** (optional): High-level game idea or theme to guide brainstorming direction

## Outputs

- **Method-Specific Artifacts**: Five separate brainstorming documents, each applying a different ideation methodology to the concept space
- **Consolidated Concept Document**: Synthesized game concepts with feasibility assessments, unique value propositions, and recommended next steps
- **Design Pillar Alignment Matrix**: Evaluation of each concept against stated design objectives and technical constraints

## Brainstorming Methods

| Method                  | Focus                    | Output Characteristics             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| SCAMPER                 | Systematic modification  | Structured transformation analysis |
| Mind Mapping            | Hierarchical exploration | Visual concept relationships       |
| Lotus Blossom           | Radial expansion         | Layered thematic development       |
| Six Thinking Hats       | Multi-perspective        | Balanced evaluation framework      |
| Random Word Association | Lateral thinking         | Unexpected conceptual combinations |
