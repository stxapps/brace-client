# Project Brainstorming Workflow

This workflow facilitates structured ideation for non-game software projects through systematic exploration of problem spaces, solution architectures, and implementation strategies. Unlike traditional requirement gathering, it employs creative techniques to uncover non-obvious approaches and identify innovative solutions that address core business needs while considering technical constraints and organizational capabilities.

The workflow operates through a project-specific context framework that captures business objectives, technical environment, stakeholder needs, and organizational constraints. It generates multiple solution vectors through parallel ideation tracks: architectural approaches, user experience paradigms, integration patterns, and value delivery mechanisms. Each track produces concrete proposals that are evaluated against feasibility, impact, and alignment with strategic objectives.

Critical differentiators include its focus on solution innovation rather than requirement enumeration, emphasis on technical-business alignment from inception, and structured approach to surfacing hidden assumptions. The workflow produces actionable outputs that directly feed into Product Brief development, ensuring that creative exploration translates into concrete planning artifacts.

## Usage

```bash
bmad bmm 1-analysis brainstorm-project
```

## Inputs

- **Project Context Document**: Business objectives, technical environment, stakeholder landscape, organizational constraints, success criteria, and known pain points
- **Problem Statement** (optional): Core business challenge or opportunity driving the project

## Outputs

- **Solution Architecture Proposals**: Multiple technical approaches with trade-off analysis and feasibility assessments
- **Value Delivery Framework**: Prioritized feature concepts aligned with business objectives and user needs
- **Risk and Opportunity Analysis**: Identified technical dependencies, integration challenges, and innovation opportunities
- **Strategic Recommendation**: Synthesized direction with rationale and implementation considerations
