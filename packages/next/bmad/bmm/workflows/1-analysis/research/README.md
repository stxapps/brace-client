## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Don't know which research type to choose

- **Solution**: Start with research question - "What do I need to know?"
  - Market viability? → `market`
  - Best technology? → `technical`
  - Need AI to research deeper? → `deep_prompt`
  - Who are competitors? → `competitive`
  - Who are users? → `user`
  - Industry understanding? → `domain`

### Issue: Market research results seem incomplete

- **Solution**: Increase research_depth to `comprehensive`
- **Check**: Enable web_research in workflow.yaml
- **Try**: Run competitive and user research separately for more depth

### Issue: Deep prompt doesn't work with target platform

- **Solution**: Review platform-specific best practices in generated prompt
- **Check**: Ensure context documents are included
- **Try**: Regenerate with different platform selection

### Issue: Technical comparison is subjective

- **Solution**: Add more objective criteria (performance metrics, cost, community size)
- **Check**: Weight criteria by business importance
- **Try**: Run pilot implementations for top 2 options

## Customization

### Adding New Research Types

1. Create new instructions file: `instructions-{type}.md`
2. Create new template file: `template-{type}.md`
3. Add research type to `workflow.yaml` `research_types` section
4. Update router logic in `instructions-router.md`

### Modifying Existing Research Types

1. Edit appropriate `instructions-{type}.md` file
2. Update corresponding `template-{type}.md` if needed
3. Adjust validation criteria in `checklist.md`

### Creating Custom Frameworks

Add to `workflow.yaml` `frameworks` section under appropriate research type.

## Version History

- **v2.0.0** - Multi-type research system with router architecture
  - Added deep_prompt research type for AI research platform optimization
  - Added technical research type for technology evaluation
  - Consolidated competitive, user, domain under market with focus variants
  - Router-based instruction loading
  - Template selection by research type
  - Enhanced Claude Code subagent support

- **v1.0.0** - Initial market research only implementation
  - Single-purpose market research workflow
  - Now deprecated in favor of v2.0.0 multi-type system

## Support

For issues or questions:

- Review workflow creation guide at `/bmad/bmb/workflows/create-workflow/workflow-creation-guide.md`
- Check validation against `checklist.md`
- Examine router logic in `instructions-router.md`
- Review research type-specific instructions
- Consult BMAD Method v6 documentation

## Migration from v1.0 market-research

If you're used to the standalone `market-research` workflow:

```bash
# Old way
workflow market-research

# New way
workflow research --type market
# Or just: workflow research (then select market)
```

All market research functionality is preserved and enhanced in v2.0.0.
