## Calculation Frameworks

### TAM Calculation Methods

1. **Industry Reports Method**
   - TAM = Industry Size × Relevant Segment %
   - Adjust for geography and use cases

2. **Population Method**
   - TAM = Total Entities × Penetration % × Average Value
   - Account for replacement cycles

3. **Value Capture Method**
   - TAM = Problem Cost × Addressable Instances × Capture Rate
   - Consider competitive alternatives

### SAM Refinement Factors

- Geographic reach limitations
- Regulatory constraints
- Technical requirements
- Language/localization needs
- Channel accessibility
- Resource constraints

### SOM Estimation Models

- **Market Share Method**: Historical comparables
- **Sales Capacity Method**: Based on resources
- **Adoption Curve Method**: Innovation diffusion
- **Competitive Response Method**: Game theory

## Data Validation Techniques
