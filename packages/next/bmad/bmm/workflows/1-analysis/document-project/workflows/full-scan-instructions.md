<workflow>

<critical>This workflow performs complete project documentation (Steps 1-12)</critical>
<critical>Called by: document-project/instructions.md router</critical>

<critical>CSV LOADING STRATEGY - Understanding the Documentation Requirements System:</critical>

<action>Display explanation to user:

**How Project Type Detection Works:**

This workflow uses 3 CSV files to intelligently document your project:

1. **project-types.csv** ({project_types_csv})
   - Contains 12 project types (web, mobile, backend, cli, library, desktop, game, data, extension, infra, embedded)
   - Each type has detection_keywords used to identify project type from codebase
   - Used ONLY during initial project classification (Step 1)

2. **documentation-requirements.csv** ({documentation_requirements_csv})
   - 24-column schema that defines what to look for in each project type
   - Columns include: requires_api_scan, requires_data_models, requires_ui_components, etc.
   - Contains file patterns (key_file_patterns, critical_directories, test_file_patterns, etc.)
   - Acts as a "scan guide" - tells the workflow WHERE to look and WHAT to document
   - Example: For project_type_id="web", requires_api_scan=true, so workflow scans api/ folder

3. **architecture-registry.csv** ({architecture_registry_csv})
   - Maps detected tech stacks to architecture templates
   - Used to select appropriate architecture document template
   - Only loaded when generating architecture documentation (Step 8)

**When Each CSV is Loaded:**

- **Fresh Start (initial_scan)**: Load project-types.csv → detect type → load corresponding doc requirements row
- **Resume**: Load ONLY the doc requirements row(s) for cached project_type_id(s)
- **Full Rescan**: Same as fresh start (may re-detect project type)
- **Deep Dive**: Load ONLY doc requirements for the part being deep-dived
  </action>

What would you like to do?

1. **Re-scan entire project** - Update all documentation with latest changes
2. **Deep-dive into specific area** - Generate detailed documentation for a particular feature/module/folder
3. **Cancel** - Keep existing documentation as-is

  <ask>Choose your scan depth level:

**1. Quick Scan** (2-5 minutes) [DEFAULT]

- Pattern-based analysis without reading source files
- Scans: Config files, package manifests, directory structure
- Best for: Quick project overview, initial understanding
- File reading: Minimal (configs, README, package.json, etc.)

**2. Deep Scan** (10-30 minutes)

- Reads files in critical directories based on project type
- Scans: All critical paths from documentation requirements
- Best for: Comprehensive documentation for brownfield PRD
- File reading: Selective (key files in critical directories)

**3. Exhaustive Scan** (30-120 minutes)

- Reads ALL source files in project
- Scans: Every source file (excludes node_modules, dist, build)
- Best for: Complete analysis, migration planning, detailed audit
- File reading: Complete (all source files)

- Place it at the end of the markdown link line
- Example: - [API Contracts - Server](./api-contracts-server.md) _(To be generated)_

<action>Before writing index.md, check which expected files actually exist:

- For each document that should have been generated, check if file exists on disk
- Set existence flags: architecture_file_exists, component_inventory_exists, dev_guide_exists, etc.
- These flags determine whether to add the _(To be generated)_ marker
- Track which files are missing in {{missing_docs_list}} for reporting
  </action>

<action>IMMEDIATELY write index.md to disk with appropriate _(To be generated)_ markers for missing files</action>
<action>Validate index has all required sections and links are valid</action>

<template-output>index</template-output>

<action>Update state file:

- Add to completed_steps: {"step": "step_10", "status": "completed", "timestamp": "{{now}}", "summary": "Master index generated"}
- Update current_step = "step_11"
- Add output: "index.md"

<critical>INCOMPLETE DOCUMENTATION DETECTION:

1. PRIMARY SCAN: Look for exact marker: _(To be generated)_
2. FALLBACK SCAN: Look for fuzzy patterns (in case agent was lazy):
   - _(TBD)_
   - _(TODO)_
   - _(Coming soon)_
   - _(Not yet generated)_
   - _(Pending)_
3. Extract document metadata from each match for user selection
   </critical>

<action>Read {output_folder}/index.md</action>

<action>Scan for incomplete documentation markers:
Step 1: Search for exact pattern "_(To be generated)_" (case-sensitive)
Step 2: For each match found, extract the entire line
Step 3: Parse line to extract:

- Document title (text within [brackets] or **bold**)
- File path (from markdown link or inferable from title)
- Document type (infer from filename: architecture, api-contracts, data-models, component-inventory, development-guide, deployment-guide, integration-architecture)
- Part ID if applicable (extract from filename like "architecture-server.md" → part_id: "server")
  Step 4: Add to {{incomplete_docs_strict}} array
  </action>

<action>Fallback fuzzy scan for alternate markers:
Search for patterns: _(TBD)_, _(TODO)_, _(Coming soon)_, _(Not yet generated)_, _(Pending)_
For each fuzzy match:

- Extract same metadata as strict scan
- Add to {{incomplete_docs_fuzzy}} array with fuzzy_match flag
  </action>

<action>Combine results:
Set {{incomplete_docs_list}} = {{incomplete_docs_strict}} + {{incomplete_docs_fuzzy}}
For each item store structure:
{
"title": "Architecture – Server",
"file*path": "./architecture-server.md",
"doc_type": "architecture",
"part_id": "server",
"line_text": "- [Architecture – Server](./architecture-server.md) *(To be generated)\_",

Would you like to:

{{#if incomplete_docs_list.length > 0}}

1. **Generate incomplete documentation** - Complete any of the {{incomplete_docs_list.length}} items above

3. Add more detail to any area [type area name]
4. Generate additional custom documentation [describe what]

  <action>For each item in {{selected_items}}:

1. **Identify the part and requirements:**
   - Extract part_id from item (if exists)
   - Look up part data in project_parts array from state file
   - Load documentation_requirements for that part's project_type_id

2. **Route to appropriate generation substep based on doc_type:**

   - Validate completeness

   **If doc_type == "deployment-guide":**
   - Display: "Generating deployment guide..."
   - Re-run Step 6 deployment configuration scan

   - Find the line containing the file link and marker
   - Remove the _(To be generated)_ or fuzzy marker text
   - Leave the markdown link intact
