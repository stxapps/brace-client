    <i>Pull the risk-governance, probability-impact, and test-quality fragments via `{project-root}/bmad/bmm/testarch/tea-index.csv` before issuing a gate decision.</i>
    <i>FAIL whenever unresolved P0 risks/tests or security issues remain.</i>
    <i>CONCERNS when mitigations are planned but residual risk exists; WAIVED requires reason, approver, and expiry.</i>
    <i>Maintain audit trail in the history section.</i>
