  <story_title>Implement "Default Mode" user setting</story_title>

  <user_story>
    As Olivia the Organizer, I want to set a default mode for adding links (e.g., "Advanced"), so that the "Add Link" popup always opens in my preferred state.
  </user_story>

  <acceptance_criteria>
    - A new UI is added to `SettingsPopupMisc.tsx` for selecting the default "Add Link" mode ("Basic," "Advanced," "Use Last Mode").
    - The preference is saved in both `settingsReducer` and `LocalSettingsReducer`.
    - A new selector in `selectors/index.ts` calculates the initial mode based on subscription, `linkEditor` state, and the new setting.
    - The action that opens the "Add Link" popup uses this selector to set the initial state.
  </acceptance_criteria>
