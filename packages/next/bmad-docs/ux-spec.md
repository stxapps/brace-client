# Brace.to UX/UI Specification

_Generated on 2025-10-17 by Wit_

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) for the new "Advanced Link Adding Mode" feature in Brace.to. This feature will allow users to add a new link and directly associate it with a specific list and tags upon creation, streamlining the organization process.

---

## 1. UX Goals and Principles

### 1.1 Target User Personas

**Persona 1: Olivia the Organizer**

*   **Who she is:** A busy professional who relies on Brace.to to save and manage a large number of links for both work and personal projects. She values efficiency and a well-organized digital workspace.

*   **Her Goal:** To save and categorize a new link in a single, seamless action. When she adds a link, she already knows which list it belongs to and what tags are relevant.

*   **Her Frustration (The "Why" behind the feature request):** The current process is multi-step. She has to add a link and then navigate back to it later to assign it to a list and add tags. This is inefficient and often leads to a backlog of unorganized links she has to clean up later.

### 1.2 Usability Goals

1.  **Efficiency:** The time it takes to add a link with a list and tags should be significantly less than the current multi-step process. We could aim for under 5 seconds for an experienced user.

2.  **Discoverability:** The "Advanced Mode" should be easy for Olivia to find when she needs it, but it shouldn't clutter the interface for users who prefer the simple "add link" functionality.

3.  **Intuitiveness:** The process of selecting a list and adding tags within the "Advanced Mode" should be self-explanatory, requiring no tutorial or instructions.

### 1.3 Design Principles

1.  **Progressive Disclosure:** We'll show only the essential UI by default and reveal the advanced options on demand. This keeps the primary interface simple while providing power when needed.

2.  **Frictionless Workflow:** The design should remove all unnecessary clicks and steps. The journey from adding a link to fully categorizing it should feel like a single, smooth action.

3.  **Clarity and Consistency:** The new UI elements will be clear, easy to understand, and visually consistent with the existing Brace.to design system.

## 2. Information Architecture

### 2.1 Site Map

The overall site map of Brace.to remains unchanged. This feature introduces two new states to the existing "Add Link" popup:

*   **Basic Mode:** The default state of the popup, showing only the essential fields for adding a link.
*   **Advanced Mode:** An optional state, revealed upon user request, which includes additional fields for selecting a list and adding tags.

### 2.2 Navigation Structure

The navigation for this feature is contained within the "Add Link" popup. The user flow is as follows:

1.  The user opens the "Add Link" popup, which appears in "Basic Mode" by default (or "Advanced Mode" if the user has set it as their preference).
2.  The user can toggle between "Basic Mode" and "Advanced Mode" by clicking a "More Options" / "Less Options" button.
3.  In "Advanced Mode", the user can:
    *   Click a "Choose List" button, which will open the `ListNamesPopup` to select a list.
    *   Interact with a tag input field, which will allow them to add new tags or choose from existing ones (similar to the `TagEditorPopup`).

## 3. User Flows

**User Flow 1: Olivia Adds a Link with Advanced Mode**

1.  **Start:** Olivia is on a page within the Brace.to app.
2.  **Action:** She clicks the "Add Link" button.
3.  **System:** The "Add Link" popup appears in its default mode.
4.  **Action:** She clicks the "More Options" button to reveal the advanced fields.
5.  **Action:** She pastes the URL she wants to save.
6.  **Action:** She clicks the "Choose List" button, which opens a list selector popup.
7.  **Action:** She selects her desired list.
8.  **System:** The list selector closes, and her chosen list is now displayed.
9.  **Action:** She clicks into the "Tags" field and types a new tag, hitting "Enter."
10. **Action:** She begins typing another tag and selects an existing one from the autocomplete suggestions.
11. **Action:** She clicks the final "Add" button.
12. **System:** The link is saved with the specified list and tags, the popup closes, and a confirmation message ("Link added to [List Name]") appears briefly.

## 4. Component Library and Design System

### 4.1 Design System Approach

We will adhere strictly to the existing Brace.to design system. No new design patterns, colors, or typography will be introduced. This ensures a consistent and predictable user experience.

### 4.2 Core Components

To build this feature, we will need the following components:

*   **New Components:**
    *   A "More Options" / "Less Options" toggle button to switch between the basic and advanced modes.
    *   A "Choose List" button that will trigger the list selection popup.
    *   A tag input field with autocomplete functionality.
*   **Reused Components:**
    *   We will reuse the existing `ListNamesPopup` for list selection.
    *   We will reuse the functionality of the `TagEditorPopup` for the tag input field.

## 5. Visual Design Foundation

### 5.1 Color Palette

The color palette will be consistent with the existing Brace.to design system.

### 5.2 Typography

**Font Families:**
All typography (font families, type scale) will be consistent with the existing Brace.to design system.

**Type Scale:**
All typography (font families, type scale) will be consistent with the existing Brace.to design system.

### 5.3 Spacing and Layout

All spacing and layout will be consistent with the existing Brace.to design system.

---

## 6. Responsive Design

### 6.1 Breakpoints

We will use the existing breakpoints already defined in the Brace.to design system. No new breakpoints will be introduced.

### 6.2 Adaptation Patterns

The "Add Link" popup will adapt to smaller screens (e.g., mobile devices) by taking up the full width of the screen to ensure all UI elements are easily accessible and legible. The layout of the advanced options will stack vertically to accommodate the narrower viewport.

---

## 7. Accessibility

### 7.1 Compliance Target

We will target **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** compliance. This is a globally recognized standard for web accessibility.

### 7.2 Key Requirements

To meet this target, we will ensure the following:

*   All UI elements, including the "More Options" button and the advanced fields, will be fully accessible via keyboard.
*   All interactive elements will have clear focus states.
*   All icons and images will have appropriate alternative text for screen readers.
*   The color contrast of all text and UI elements will meet WCAG AA guidelines.
*   The UI will be tested for compatibility with common screen readers.

---

## 8. Interaction and Motion

### 8.1 Motion Principles

*   **Subtle and Purposeful:** Animations will be used sparingly and with clear intent, such as guiding the user's focus or providing feedback. They should enhance the experience, not distract from it.
*   **Consistent and Predictable:** All animations and interactions will be consistent with the established motion design of the Brace.to application.

### 8.2 Key Animations

*   **Expansion/Collapse:** The "Advanced Mode" section will smoothly expand and collapse when the "More Options" / "Less Options" button is clicked.
*   **Popup Transitions:** The `ListNamesPopup` will use a gentle fade-in and fade-out transition.
*   **Feedback:** Subtle highlighting will be used to provide feedback when a list is selected or a tag is added.

### 9.2 Key Screen Layouts

This section will contain wireframes and mockups of the key screens for this feature, including the 'Basic Mode' and 'Advanced Mode' of the 'Add Link' popup. These will be created in the design phase.
