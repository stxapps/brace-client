# Technical Decisions Log

_Auto-updated during discovery and planning sessions - you can also add information here yourself_

## Purpose

This document captures technical decisions, preferences, and constraints discovered during project discussions. It serves as input for solution-architecture.md and solution design documents.

## Confirmed Decisions

<!-- Technical choices explicitly confirmed by the team/user -->

## Preferences

<!-- Non-binding preferences mentioned during discussions -->

## Constraints

<!-- Hard requirements from infrastructure, compliance, or integration needs -->

## To Investigate

<!-- Technical questions that need research or architect input -->

## Notes

- This file is automatically updated when technical information is mentioned
- Decisions here are inputs, not final architecture
- Final technical decisions belong in solution-architecture.md
- Implementation details belong in solutions/\*.md and story context or dev notes.
