## Explanation

The architecture of the Brace Client Next.js project is a typical client-server architecture.

*   **Client:** The client is a web browser that runs the Next.js application. The application is built with React and uses Redux for state management.
*   **Server:** The server is a Node.js application that provides an API for the client. The API is used to fetch and store data in a database.

## Data Flow

1.  The user interacts with the application in the web browser.
2.  The application dispatches an action to the Redux store.
3.  The Redux store updates its state.
4.  The application re-renders based on the new state.
5.  If necessary, the application makes a request to the API to fetch or store data.
6.  The API interacts with the database to retrieve or store the data.
7.  The API returns a response to the application.
8.  The application updates its state based on the response from the API.
