          <h2 className={tailwind('pt-8 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900')}>System requirements</h2>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-3 leading-7')}>Use of the Service requires compatible hardware (fees may apply), Internet access (fees may apply), and certain software (fees may apply), and may require obtaining updates or upgrades from time to time. Because use of the Service involves hardware, software, and Internet access, your ability to use the Service may be affected by the performance of these factors. You acknowledge and agree that such system requirements, which may be changed from time to time, are your responsibility.</p>

          <h2 className={tailwind('pt-8 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900')}>Changes to the Service</h2>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-3 leading-7')}>STX Apps reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any portion thereof) with or without notice and without liability to you.

          <h2 className={tailwind('pt-8 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900')}>Our content</h2>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-3 leading-7')}>STX Apps or its licensors and suppliers own all rights, title and interest in the App(s) and the software and other technology used to provide the Service and all associated intellectual property rights ("Our Technology"), and Our Technology is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. Our Technology is licensed, not sold, to you for use only under the terms and conditions of these Terms. STX Apps reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-5 leading-7')}>Brace.to, the Brace.to logo, Brace.to product screen shots and the Brace.to "B" App Icon design and Justnote, the Justnote logo, Justnote product screen shot and the Justnote "N" App Icon design are trademarks or the subject of other intellectual property rights of STX Apps, and may not be used without prior, express written permission from STX Apps. All other trademarks not owned by STX Apps that appear on the Service are the property of their respective owners, who may or may not be affiliated with, connected to, or sponsored by STX Apps. All content included on the Service, including all information, data, text, software, music, sounds, photographs, graphics, videos, messages, scripts, tags, compilations of the foregoing and/or other materials accessible through the Service, including all associated intellectual property rights ("Our Content"), is the property of STX Apps and/or its licensors, as applicable, and protected by intellectual property and other laws and treaties. Except as expressly permitted under these Terms, no reproduction, transmission, modification or display of any of Our Content is permitted without our prior, express written permission.</p>

          <h2 className={tailwind('pt-8 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900')}>Information you provide</h2>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-3 leading-7')}>You agree to read our Privacy Policy, which explains what type of information we collect and what might happen to that information, including, without limitation, how such information is shared and used. Our Privacy Policy also explains how we retain and delete the collected information and how you can request deletion of your information.</p>

          <h2 className={tailwind('pt-8 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900')}>Your account and Secret Key</h2>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-3 leading-7')}>Your account is a <a className={tailwind('rounded-sm font-medium text-gray-900 underline focus:outline-none focus:ring')} href="https://www.stacks.co" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Stacks</a> account and a Stacks account is used to access Stacks blockchain and Stacks data server. Stacks blockchain stores your account's information i.e. username, profile, and data server location. And Stacks data server stores your encrypted app data.</p>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-3 leading-7')}>You are responsible for the security of your account, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account whether or not authorized by you. The STX Apps Parties will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of your Account.</p>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-5 leading-7')}>You acknowledge that if you lose your Secret Key, your Secret Key will be lost forever. Only you know your Secret Key, which means that no one can help you recover it. You agree that the STX Apps Parties shall not be liable for any loss or damange arising from unaccessible of your account.</p>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-5 leading-7')}>Your Secret Key cannot be changed or reset. As your Secret Key is used to encrypt your data, each file individually, if you change your Secret Key, every file needs to be decrypted with your old Secret Key and encrypted again with your new Secret Key.</p>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-5 leading-7')}>If you create an account with STX Apps, currently we create your Stacks account without username, profile, and data server location so there is no data stored in Stacks blockchain and your data server is automatically selected. You acknowledge and agree that as no data stored in Stacks blockchain, after deleting all your data in the data server, there is nothing left and forgetting your Secret Key is the way to permanently delete your account.</p>

          <h2 className={tailwind('pt-8 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900')}>Fees and subscription</h2>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-3 leading-7')}>While the basic functionality of the Service is free for use, additional data charges may apply to you for mobile use of the Service through your mobile device. Additional fees may also apply for use of additional features of the Service. If there is a charge associated with a portion of the Service, you agree to pay that charge by accessing or using it. The price stated for the Service may be denominated in your local currency by Apple App Store, Google Play Store, by STX Apps through a third party payment processing service, or any other applicable App Store through which you download the App(s) on your device. Fees and charges are collected by the App Store on your device. You should consult with the appropriate App Store to determine if the price charged includes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements. STX Apps relies on the App Store to collect subscription fees and to report on the status of subscription accounts. Your access to the additional features may be suspended or cancelled if you do not make your payment on-time and/or in full.</p>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-5 leading-7')}>If you purchase one or more subscriptions or sign up for one or more trial subscriptions to the Service, then the following terms apply:</p>
          <ol className={tailwind('list-alpha')}>
            <li className={tailwind('ml-10 pt-5')}>Auto-Renewal. YOU AGREE THAT, ONCE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD EXPIRES, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION(S) WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR SUCCESSIVE PERIODS EQUAL IN LENGTH TO THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD UNLESS AND UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION(S). You acknowledge and agree that deletion of your account does not cancel your subscription(s) and you must cancel your subscription(s) explicitly through the applicable App Store.</li>
            <li className={tailwind('ml-10 pt-5')}>Recurring Charges. If you register for a paid subscription, YOU AUTHORIZE STX APPS' APPLICABLE SERVICE PROVIDER TO PROCESS YOUR PAYMENTS FOR ANY RENEWAL SUBSCRIPTION(S). SUBSCRIPTION PRICES WILL BE PROVIDED TO YOU AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. YOU WILL BE BILLED FOR THE SAME SUBSCRIPTION PLAN(S) (OR THE MOST SIMILAR SUBSCRIPTION PLAN(S), IF YOUR PRIOR PLAN(S) ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE) AT THE THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PRICE PLUS ANY APPLICABLE TAXES. YOUR PAYMENTS WILL BE PROCESSED FOR ANY RENEWAL SUBSCRIPTION(S) USING THE SAME BILLING CYCLE AS YOUR CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION(S). IN OTHER WORDS, ON WHICHEVER DAY YOUR PAYMENT IS PROCESSED FOR YOUR CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION(S), YOUR PAYMENT WILL CONTINUE TO BE PROCESSED ON THAT DAY FOR ANY RENEWAL SUBSCRIPTION(S). ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS MAY APPLY UPON RENEWAL, AND SUBSCRIPTION FEES MAY CHANGE AT ANY TIME, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. However, if you do not agree to an applicable change in fees, you may cancel your subscription(s) at any time in accordance below.</li>
            <li className={tailwind('ml-10 pt-5')}>Cancellation. YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION(S) AT ANY TIME THROUGH GOOGLE PLAY STORE (IF YOU MANAGE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION(S) THROUGH AN ANDROID DEVICE) OR THROUGH APPLE APP STORE (IF YOU MANAGE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION(S) THROUGH AN IOS-BASED DEVICE). STX APPS HAS NO OBLIGATION TO OFFER OR PROVIDE ANY REFUND FOR THE CANCELLATION OF ANY SUBSCRIPTION, BUT YOU CAN CONTINUE TO USE THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE UNTIL THE END OF THE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD THAT YOU PAID FOR.</li>
          </ol>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-5 leading-7')}>You must make all payments through a charge through the applicable App Store. You agree to pay all fees and charges incurred in connection with your use of the Service (including any applicable taxes) at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred. BETWEEN YOU AND STX APPS, YOU, AND NOT STX APPS, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS FOR THE SERVICE BILLED TO YOUR MOBILE DEVICE, PAYPAL, CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD BY AN APP STORE OR THIRD PARTY WHO HAD ACCESS TO THESE ACCOUNTS, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH AMOUNTS WERE AUTHORIZED BY YOU.</p>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-5 leading-7')}>We reserve the right in the future to charge for use of our services that are currently available free of charge. You will not be charged for using any service unless you have opted for a paid subscription plan.</p>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-5 leading-7')}>We may decide to stop offering subscriptions at any time, including in response to unforeseen circumstances beyond our control, or to comply with a legal requirement; if so, we’ll cancel your subscription(s) and refund the prorated portion of any prepaid subscription fee(s) equal to the remaining unused term of the subscription.</p>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-5 leading-7')}>We do not issue refunds for paid subscriptions. You may do so in the App Store through which you purchase the subscription, subject to the applicable App Store Terms i.e if you purchased a subscription on your iOS device, such as an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, you may request a refund via the Apple App Store (support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084).</p>

          <h2 className={tailwind('pt-8 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900')}>Indemnification</h2>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-3 leading-7')}>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold the STX Apps Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, suits, actions, losses, costs, damages, and any other liabilities, including attorneys' fees, arising out of or related to your use of the Service and/or your interactions with other users of the Service, including, but not limited to, (i) your use or misuse of any geographic location information or the Service generally, (ii) any violation of the rights of any other person or entity by you, (iii) any breach or violation by you of these Terms or any law, regulation or guidance, (iv) your access to and use of the Service, including without limitation, to communicate with or meet another user in-person or to locate and attend any offline place or event or to post, store, share, send, transmit, or disseminate any content, or (v) any negligent acts, omissions or willful misconduct by you. STX Apps reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims.</p>

          <h2 className={tailwind('pt-8 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900')}>Miscellaneous</h2>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-3 leading-7')}>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then such provision shall be construed, limited, modified or, if necessary, severed to the extent necessary to eliminate its invalidity or unenforceability, without in any way affecting the remaining parts of these Terms. Such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability only, without in any way affecting the remaining parts of these Terms.</p>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-5 leading-7')}>A provision of these Terms may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the party entitled to the benefit of such provision. The failure of any party at any time to require performance of any provision of these Terms shall in no manner affect such party's right at a later time to enforce the same. A waiver of any breach of any provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a continuing waiver of other breaches of the same or other provisions of these Terms.</p>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-5 leading-7')}>These Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to another party without the express written consent of STX Apps.</p>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-5 leading-7')}>The parties acknowledge that these Terms are concluded between you and STX Apps only, and not with the owner or operator of any other applicable App Store through which you may have downloaded the App(s) (the "App Store Owner"), and the App Store Owner is not responsible for the App(s) and the contents thereof. The App Store Owner has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App(s). STX Apps, not the App Store Owner, is responsible for addressing any claims from you or any third party relating to the App(s) or your possession and/or use of the App(s), including, but not limited to, product liability claims, any claim that the App(s)s fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement and claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. The App Store Owner and its subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and shall have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third party beneficiary hereof.</p>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-5 leading-7')}>These Terms constitute the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between STX Apps and you with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede any proposal or prior or contemporaneous agreement, oral or written, and any other communications between the parties in relation to the subject matter of these Terms.</p>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-5 leading-7')}>You represent and warrant that you are not (i) located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a "terrorist supporting" country; and (ii) listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties, including, but not limited to, the Specially Designated Nationals List.</p>
          <p className={tailwind('pt-5 leading-7')}>YOU AND STX APPS AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>
